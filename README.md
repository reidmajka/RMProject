<br> Title: Does installing dedicated bike lanes really serve everyone?

<br><br> Description: Using bike lane data, population data, traffic data(?) and pedestrian accident data, derive whether increased bike lanes reduces the amount of overall pedestrian accidents within cities, and also improves overall traffic flow (?) (reduced road congestion and reduces drivers who switch to biking). Find as many databases as possible (start with available bike lane data by metro area/city/region, find correlating data for population, accidents, density etc.).

<br><br>Notes: unsure if I should analyse BOTH traffic reduction AND accidents, or only one. Need to find a way to effectively consolidate data sources (as of now, can only find data sources by one city at a time).
